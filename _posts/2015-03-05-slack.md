Slack chat spaces are divided into rooms called “channels”, and we have several set up. There are two you’ll be in by default:

- <strong>#announcements</strong>: occasional announcements and discussion about group governance
- <strong>#main</strong>: meet and greet; general chat

All rooms are opt-in except <strong>announcements</strong>, which is why we try to keep it low-volume.
