## Who are we 

We are group of people, based mainly around New Zealand and Australia, who have an interest in all forms of security and also have an interest in getting more women involved.

### What we do

We host various topics monthly to discuss multiple areas of security - From the technical nitty gritty, breaking-into-things fun - To the soft topics that impact womens' decisions to get into security.

### Why we do it

Because there are heaps of smart and inquisitive women that enjoy tinkering and learning about security - and we would be keen to work along side them. We want to help all women (or those that identify as such) succeed within security and provide that support where they may need it. Secure Women is a safe environment for everyone to discuss questions, current events, and other interesting things related security.
