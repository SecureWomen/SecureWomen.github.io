# Secure Women

Welcome to the public landing page for the <a href="">Secure Women Slack group</a>. Our group is a <strong>safe, inclusive space for security-focused women</strong> to chat and support each other. Please consider joining us whether you are new to the security industry, want to bring security to your existing role or you are a long-time practitioner.

<strong>Not a security professional? That's fine!</strong> Security is important to every function in our organisations so come and have a chat.
